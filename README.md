# clangen... but wings of fire

Initially created by **just-some-cat**, edit created by **SableSteel** (and many others!!), this mod currently just created by **CrimsonWing1** (me!)

(Though I *do* have someone in mind to ask for help because of their talents, they're known (to me at least, when it comes to long term things) for either getting tired and not getting back to you or getting bored of a project and ghosting it.)


## Progress
### Finished -
- Tribes generating for new cats
  
### In Progress -
- Getting tribes to actually save
- Changing role names and clan naming
  
### Will be added -
- Inheriting parent's tribe(s)
- Different name system depending on tribe
- Sprite redraws (obviously)
- Thought/event/patrol rewrites
- Condition/illness rewrites / tribe-specific conditions/illnesses (like firescales, or a MudWing drying out, etc)
- Patrol art redraws
- Any needed UI changes for anything that says cat
